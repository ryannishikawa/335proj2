To run the program for algorithm 1:
    1) chmod +x r1.sh
        - to make sure the shell script has permission to execute.
    2) ./r1.sh
        - to run the shell script which compiles and runs the program.
        - compiles the code with g++ -o target_str target_str.cpp
    3) Because target_str.cpp is hardcoded to use in2a.txt for input, you must modify the in2a.txt file to test different inputs.
    4) After running the program, the input with its matching output will be printed to the console.
