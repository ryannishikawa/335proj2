The Run Encoding Problem is:

Input: a string 𝑆 of 𝑛 characters, where each character is a lower-case letter or space

Output: a string 𝐶 where each run of 𝑘 repetitions of the character 𝑥 is replaced with the
string "𝑘𝑥"

def runEncode(S):
    n = length of string
    answer = " "

    for i from 0 to n-1:
        k = 1

        while i is less than n-1 and S[i] is equal to S[i+1]:
            k = k + 1
            i = i + 1
        
        if k > 1:
            append k as a string to answer
        append S[i] to answer
    
    return answer

Mathematical Analysis:

"for i from 0 to n-1" runs at most n times.

The while loop would loop, in the worst case, an n amount of times if all the characters within string S are the same.
Since i only moves forward, the total number of loops happening would be at most n.

Appending to the string answer is a (amortized) constant time operation, O(1). 

Therefore, the efficiency class of this algorithm is O(n).
